There are two programs, oldfiles.c and utimefu.c
Oldfiles is for listing old files and optionally deleting
those listed files, along with removing some files from the
deletion list by renewing utimes.
Utimefu.c is useful for setting arbitrary times on a file or groups
of files.

Compile these programs thusly:
gcc -Wall oldfiles.c -o oldfiles
gcc -Wall utimefu.c -o utimefu

Install if required by:
sudo cp olfiles /usr/local/bin
sudo cp utimefu /usr/local/bin

Any warnings during compilation should be considered bugs.

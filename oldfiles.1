.\" Title: Program name, manual section, and date
.TH PROG 1
.\" Section heading: NAME, followed by command name and one line summary
.\" It's important to copy this exactly; the "whatis" database (used
.\" for apropos) looks for the summary line.
.SH NAME
prog \- create output from input
.\" Section heading: SYNOPSIS, followed by syntax summary
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B prog
\" .B: bold font; use it for the command name.
[ -b ] [ -c ] [ -d ] \" Put optional arguments in square brackets.
[ input [ output ]]
\" Arguments can be spread across several lines.

\" End the synopsis with an explicit line break (.br)
.\" A new section: DESCRIPTION, followed by what the command does
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Prog
\" .I: Italic font for the word "Prog"
performs lots of computations. Input to
.IR prog ,
\" .IR: One word italic, next word roman, no space between.
is taken from the file
.IR input ,
and output is sent to the file
.IR output ,
which default to standard input and standard output if not specified.
.\" Another section: now we're going to discuss the -b, -c, and -d options
.SH OPTIONS
.\" The .TP macro precedes each option
.TP
.B \-b \" print the -b option in bold.
Print output in binary.
.TP
.B \-c \" \- requests a minus sign, which is preferable to a hyphen (-)
Eliminate ASCII characters from input before processing.
.TP
.B \-d
Cause daemons to overrun your computer.
.\" OK, we're done with the description and the options; now mention
.\" other requirements (like environment and files needed) as well as
.\" what can go wrong. You can add any other sections you want.
.SH FILES

.SH BUGS
In order to optimize computational speed, this program always produces
the same result, independent of the input.
.\" Use .LP between paragraphs
.LP
If the moon is full,
.I prog
may destroy your input file. To say nothing of your sex life.
.\" Good manual pages end by stating who wrote the program.
